We discuss and evaluate multiple concepts and models here
1. Logistic regression
2. Random forest Classification
3. SVM classification
4. XGBoost
5. Imputation for missing data - Using regression to fill missing data
6. Feature Engineering

And with some inputs from another submission (referred to in the notebook) we achieve 77.99% accuracy
